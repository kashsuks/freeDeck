Today I had the very bright idea of making my own hackpad from scratch (without the tutorial and no videos etc) in order to get much better at CAD. I realized that my CAD skills are very underwhelming since switching directly from Hackpad v2 to a custom project in which the CAD was pretty complicated. It took me hours on end just to get started and make a very small change.

## Why make a stream deck?

I've gotten quite a bit into streaming programming contests and competitions on my YouTube so I realized that having a stream deck that can help me change scenes, mute/unmute, start/stop stream, etc.

I made my keyboard layout, first I scrolled through the hotkeys section on OBS in order to see which ones I *really* needed, and chose them!
